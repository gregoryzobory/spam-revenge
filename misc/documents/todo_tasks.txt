REMEMBER!
=========
Each time you change the logic / update NPM package version, do the following steps:
1. Perform a backup before any change has been made, by running on termine 'npm run backup' or manually to the backups directory.
2. After the change, check that everything works OK.
3. Keep the maintenance - Every change you do - Make sure to update in this document if needed.
4. Do commit + push on Git project repository.
5. Keep the backup update - Every change you do - Update in iOmega (each couple of days do backup there).
=================================

ToDo tasks:
===========
-First logic - Get local IP addresses + public IP address + port. Validate all IP addresses and ports.
-Second logic - Find a working proxy and test it. Validate all IP addresses and ports + Make sure not any of
 local or public IP address included in any header of the proxy.
-Add validation on specific email addresses from settings.
-Add validation on the target email addresses.
-If the proxy not working - Random aother one and repeat the process of validation. Random the proxies from different sources.
-If it works - Start the third part.
-Third logic - Register new email address + Make a sample of subscribtion to spam. Await for textbox and button to load.
-If the text box or the button don't exists, or the URL failed to be load, add to fail and contine to the next one.
-Add flag if to use proxy or not. Add validation that if PRODUCTION and this flag is false, exit.
-Once button was clicked, wait at least 5 seconds before moving to the next spam URL.
-Make a JSON file full with spam URLs - Validate all to have:
-URL (valid URL), Text box field name, text box field value, button field name, button field value (id will be given automaticlly).
-The JSON file needs to be external - a path in the settings to validate (validate it's a file path).
-Make a delay between each subscription.
-Make a final test - Register a new email + Subscribe to all spam at once.
-Try to find as many spam URLs as you can.
-No log wiriting operations need to be included.
-Include maximum count of spam subscription, and if by order or random.
-The console status logic should look like this:
===[SETTINGS] Mode: PRODUCTION | Method: STANDARD/RANDOM | Maximum Limit: ## | Emails: 1===
===[GENERAL] Time: 00.00:00:08 [-] | scam@wzdr.com (1/2) | Progress: 364/700 (64.24%) | Status: VALIDATION/SUBSCRIBE/PAUSE/EXIT/LIMIT_EXIDED===
===[LOCAL] IP Local: 172.45.323.12 | IP Public: 82.34.234.72 | Other IPs: | | | ===
===[PROXY] IP: 192.249.53.67 | Port: 64312 | Country: us | Protocol: socks4 | Anonymity Level: Elite | Source: proxyscrape-com===
